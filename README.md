# Simply Tasks Manager

This simply app allows manage yor very simply tasks by the console. 

## How it works?
You have to on your OS have installed Java. Then you can copy directory `/executable_JAR_file`. Input in this directory and run command `java -jar java-basics-workshop-tasks-1.0`. 

You can use command:

`add` - to add new tasks with description, date and important flag

`list` - to show your tasks

`remove` - to delete your task by id

`exit` - exit app ;-)

Tasks are saved to `.csv` file.
